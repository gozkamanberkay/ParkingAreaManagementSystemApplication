# CoreUI Free Admin Dashboard Template for Angular 19

CoreUI is meant to be the UX game changer. Pure & transparent code is devoid of redundant components, so the app is light enough to offer ultimate user
experience. This means mobile devices also, where the navigation is just as easy and intuitive as on a desktop or laptop. The CoreUI Layout API lets you
customize your project for almost any device – be it Mobile, Web or WebApp – CoreUI covers them all!

#### <i>Prerequisites</i>

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes `Node.js®` and an `npm` package manager.

###### Node.js

[**Angular 19**](https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular) requires `Node.js` LTS version `^18.19.1` or `^20.11.1`.

- To check your version, run `node -v` in a terminal/console window.
- To get `Node.js`, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

###### Angular CLI

Install the Angular CLI globally using a terminal/console window.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Installation

``` bash
$ npm install
$ npm update
```

### Basic usage

``` bash
# dev server with hot reload at http://localhost:4200
$ npm start
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Build

Run `build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

```bash
# build for production with minification
$ npm run build
```
